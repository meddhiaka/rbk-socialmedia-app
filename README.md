# Front-End Project Challenge Rebootkamp

This project 24hours Rebootcamp challenge aimed at implementing a medium-level front-end task.

In this README, I will outline what has been accomplished in this project, including state management, responsive design, preview image functionality, data validation, and image conversion to base64.

## Project Overview

This front-end project challenge focused on developing a responsive web application with the following features:

- **State Management:**
  - Utilized [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for efficient management of application state, This ensures data consistency and a smooth user experience.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Implemented a responsive design using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to ensure that the application is user-friendly and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Preview Image Ready:**
  - Developed a feature that allows users to preview uploaded images before finalizing their selection. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback.

- **Data Validation:**
  - Implemented data validation to ensure that user inputs are accurate and meet specified criteria. This includes error handling for invalid inputs.

- **Image Conversion to Base64:**
  - Integrated functionality to convert uploaded images to base64 format using Tailwind CSS. This enables efficient storage and transmission of image data within the application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
